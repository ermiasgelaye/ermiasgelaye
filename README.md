My name is Ermias Gelaye Gaga, I am a data research analyst with over 7 years of proven experience working in a fast-paced, and dynamic digital environment, and handling data. Possess a Master of Cognitive Science from the University of Trento, Italy, and a Certificate in Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp from the University of Toronto.

Excited to leverage my background, and training working with a team of collaborative researchers focused on mining, analyzing, visualizing, and delivering data sourced from heterogeneous databases.

I have worked on a variety of data projects, which include data analysis, visualization, and bullding data pipelines. I will showcase some of my projects here.

During my free time, I like to write and code. I enjoy working on different challenges, which help sharpen my mind and improve on my problem solving skills. I like telling data stories around the data science projects that I do.
